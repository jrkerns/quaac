Data Models

Overview
--------

The QuAAC specification has 5 data models:

* Document
* Data Point
* Equipment
* User
* Attachment

Each of these models represent one of the main components in a QA workflow.
The following flowchart shows how these models are related to each other:

Following the flowchart, the data models are described in detail below.

* **Document** - A document is a container for any number of other models.
  A document is not the same thing as a file, but documents can be stored as files.
  Importantly, documents can be merged together to form a new document, and by extension, a new file.
  Documents can write to file as well as load from a file.

* **Equipment** - Equipment is a piece of hardware or software that generates data or attachments.
  It can be the equipment the QA is performed on, or it can be ancillary equipment that is used to measure or process data
  from some primary piece of equipment. Examples include linacs, chambers, electrometers, TPSs, CT simulators, etc.

* **User** - A user is a person who performs or reviews QA.

* **Attachment** - An attachment is a file or other binary data that is associated with a data point.
  It could be the raw data that was used to generate a data point, or it could be a report from an intermediate analysis, corroborating the data point.
  Attachments can be any file type, such as images, PDFs, text files, etc.
  Attachments are generated by equipment. Examples include DICOM files, PDF reports, screenshots, spreadsheets, etc.

* **Data Point** - A data point is a single measurement or calculation. It can be any data type.
  Data points are generated by equipment or attachments and are reviewed by users.
